      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Full-stack developer with a talent for creating seamless digital experiences. I transform ideas into dynamic,
        easy-to-use web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love combining creativity and code to deliver solutions that not only work, but also achieve goals in the most
        effective way possible. I believe programming is a way to improve people's lives, and the aspiration to achieve
        something like this is my greatest motivation on a daily basis. I strive to achieve not only that, but also to
        deliver well-tested code that makes my coworkers' lives easier and creates a positive environment for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in Córdoba, Argentina, on July 17, 2003. From a very young age, I developed a strong interest in
        computers, creating Pokémon hackroms and Renpy games. Today, I'm dedicated solely to improving my programming
        skills and maximizing my potential to deliver the best I can to the industry I'm passionate about.
